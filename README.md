**Currently**:
- 🧪 Researching compute-efficient model architecture at OpenAI's Training team
- 🔬 [Understanding](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/pyvene/blob/main/pyvene/models/blip/modelings_blip_itm.py) how vision-language models build syntactic representations
- ⤴ Scaling up [neural satisfiability solvers](https://github.com/KhoomeiK/SATScale)
- 📈 Exploring how [scaling laws scale with data complexity](https://github.com/KhoomeiK/complexity-scaling)
- 👾 [Fine-tuning](https://github.com/KhoomeiK/LlamaGym) LLM agents to play games with online RL
- ↩️ [Replacing backprop](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ulYQn9TG-beTg7u0lwLmVnqFGIXdGHPh) in autoregressive language models

**Previously**:
- 🙈 Engineer #1 @ [Reworkd](https://github.com/reworkd/) working on [multimodal code-generation](https://github.com/reworkd/tarsier) for web data extraction
- 🎓 Graduated from Carnegie Mellon '23 with Honors in Computer Science
  - 🔍 My [thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16328) on vision-language semantics is cited by Google Brain, Meta AI, Stanford, etc.

- 🧑‍💻 Exited a content research micro-SaaS with some cool clustering, fact checking, & generation features
- 🤖 Fine-tuned language models at Microsoft AI over summer '22
- 🛠️ Worked on information retrieval, question answering, & summarization at various startups '20-21
- 🧠 Developed brain-computer interfaces with NSF funding and [placed 1st](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh11Pg4uLxQ) nationally at NeuroTechX '20
- 🏆 Won 10+ [hackathons](https://devpost.com/RohanPandey) including 1st @ Facebook '19, 2nd @ UCLA '19, 3rd @ MIT '20

**Warning**: has not learnt the Bitter Lesson. Prone to getting nerd-sniped by linguistically & cognitively motivated AI research directions.
